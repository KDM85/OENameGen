Old English Name and Place Name Generator

OESample.py demonstrates how to use the functions

OENameGen.py is a simple tool to generate an Old English given name from pre-built lists. Male names have a chance of being monothematic, but are typically dithematic. All female names generated will be dithematic.
Dithematic names (especially male names) may sometimes be redundant (ie "Ƿulfƿulf" or "Beorhtbeorht").

OEPlaceNameGen.py is a simple tool to generate an Old English place name from pre-built lists.
